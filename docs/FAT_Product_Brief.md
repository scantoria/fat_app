### The Problem

Large animal farmers face two critical challenges that no existing solution adequately addresses:

**1. Veterinary Access Crisis**
- Specialty large animal vets (internal medicine, dermatology, nutrition) are scarce in rural areas
- Wait times for farm visits range from 2-7 days for non-emergencies
- Emergency situations require immediate guidance that on-site visits cannot provide
- Geographic gaps: thoroughbred centers have equine vets, but cattle/goat/sheep specialists are extremely limited

**2. Health Record Fragmentation**
- Critical health data scattered across paper records, memory, and Excel files
- Questions like "When was this cow bred?" or "When did that foal receive its last deworming?" require digging through files
- No centralized system designed specifically for large animal farms (horses, cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys)
- Existing practice management software built for small animal clinics, not farms

**Real-World Impact:**
A farmer in Versailles, KY (thoroughbred capital) cannot find a goat veterinarian. A cattle farmer notices potential illness on Monday, waits until Friday for a vet visit, and loses valuable time for treatment.

### The Solution

**Farm Animal Tracker delivers two core capabilities:**

**1. Instant Veterinary Access (Primary Value)**
Get specialty veterinary guidance in hours, not days, through photo-based telemedicine consultations.

**How It Works:**
- Farmer uploads photo(s) of sick/injured animal with description
- Available specialty vets (internal medicine, nutrition, dermatology) notified immediately (push, text, email)
- Vet responds within 2 hours (when queue monitored) or 48 hours maximum
- Asynchronous Q&A via messaging for clarification
- Vet escalates to live video if needed (included, no extra charge)
- Treatment plan and recommendations provided
- All consultation notes automatically saved to animal's health record

**2. Complete Health Record System (Supporting Value)**
Centralized, organized tracking for every animal across multiple farms.

**Tracked Data:**
- Breeding dates, cycles, and history
- Birth records and lineage
- Vaccination schedules and administration
- Deworming treatments
- Illness/injury logs with photos
- Weight tracking over time
- Medication history (OTC and prescription)
- Veterinary visit notes and treatment plans
- Lactation tracking for dairy animals

### Key Features

**For Farmers:**
- Multi-species support: horses, cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys
- Multi-farm management under single account
- Offline-capable mobile app (critical for rural connectivity)
- Photo/document uploads for each animal
- User role management (Owner, Manager, Lead, Farm Hand)
- Provider queue visibility (see available vets by specialty and language)
- Cross-timezone coverage (Eastern vets can serve Pacific farmers)

**For Veterinarians:**
- Opt-in to consultation queue when available
- Access to complete animal health history during consult
- Flexible response: async messaging or video escalation
- Earn income during downtime without farm visit overhead
- Build client relationships through favorites system
- Multi-lingual capabilities (self-reported)

**Consult Structure:**
- **$25 flat fee** per consultation
- Covers **up to 10 animals** with the same health issue (herd-level assessment)
- **24-hour interaction window** with up to 10 messages
- **Video escalation included** if vet deems necessary
- Clear scope: one health issue, one consult period

### Why This Works

**Compared to Traditional Farm Visit:**
- Farm visit: $50+ visit fee, $X per animal, days of waiting = $150-300+ total
- FAT APP consult: $25 flat fee, 2-hour response = fraction of the cost

**Technology Advantage:**
- Photo-first approach reduces unnecessary video calls
- Async messaging respects both parties' schedules
- Vet can review animal's complete health history before responding
- Treatment plans automatically documented in records

**Market Timing:**
- Telehealth proven successful for small animal/companion pets
- Large animal telehealth is dramatically underserved
- Rural broadband expansion enables video consultations
- Specialty vet shortage worsening (particularly in rural areas)

### Target Market

**Primary Users - Farmers:**
- Large animal operations (horses, cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys)
- Farm sizes: Small to mid-sized (5-200 head)
- Geographic focus: Rural and semi-rural US (initial launch)
- Pain points: Limited vet access, need for specialty expertise, record-keeping burden

**Primary Users - Veterinarians:**
- Specialty focus: Internal medicine, animal nutrition, dermatology
- Practice types: Solo practitioners and multi-doctor clinics
- Value proposition: New revenue stream, flexible scheduling, no travel overhead
- Geographic: US-only at launch (international expansion considered for future)

**Initial Beta Market:**
- Thoroughbred horse community in Versailles, KY region
- Built-in network of farm owners and veterinarians
- High-value animals justify investment in quality care
- Strong word-of-mouth potential

### Pricing Model

**Platform Access (Both Sides):**
- **$5/month subscription** = "Pay to play" fee
- Farmers: Unlimited health records + ability to request consultations
- Vets: Access to consultation queue + ability to accept consultations
- No free tier to prevent abuse and maintain quality

**Consultation Fees:**
- **$25 flat rate** per consultation (regardless of length)
- Simple, predictable pricing
- Farmer pays $25 → Platform keeps $2.50 (10%) → Vet receives $22.50 (90%)

**Revenue Model:**
- Recurring: $5/mo × (farmers + vets) = predictable monthly recurring revenue
- Transaction: 10% of every consultation = volume-based growth revenue
- Scalable: More users = more MRR, more consults = more transaction fees

**Value Comparison:**
- Farmers save 80%+ vs. traditional farm visits
- Vets earn ~$90/hour for consultation work during downtime
- Platform provides instant access to specialty expertise

### Service Level Agreement

**Response Times:**
- **2-hour response** when queue is actively monitored by available vets
- **48-hour maximum** when queue has limited availability
- Vets accept SLA requirements when joining queue

**SLA Violation Remediation:**
- Farmers receive consultation coupon for future use
- Maintains trust and accountability
- Encourages vet queue participation

### Consultation Guardrails
