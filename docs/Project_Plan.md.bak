# Project: Farm Animal Tracker Application

This document outlines the refined plan for the Farm Animal Tracker application, summarizing the project's goals, technology stack, and core features.

## 1. Project Goal

The goal of the Farm Animal Tracker application is to provide a comprehensive, centralized platform for managing the health, breeding, and logistics of horses, cattle, goats, sheep, and donkeys across multiple farm locations. The application will track critical information for each animal, including health records, breeding events, and feeding regimens, to facilitate data-driven decision-making and improve farm management efficiency.

## 1A. Business Model

The application is designed to be accessible to small and rural farmers while creating sustainable revenue streams through professional services.

### Revenue Streams

**Primary Subscription:**
- $5.00/month per farm - Base subscription for core farm management features
- Affordable pricing to ensure accessibility for small farmers
- Includes full animal tracking, health records, breeding management, and offline capabilities

**User Licensing:**
- Each user assigned to an Owner's farm requires a separate license
- Owner is billed for each user license at $5.00/month per user
- If a user works for multiple owners, each owner pays for that user's license separately
  - Example: Farm Hand works for Owner A and Owner B
  - Owner A pays one license fee for that user
  - Owner B pays one license fee for that same user
  - Total: 2 licenses billed (one to each owner)
- Owner and designated Managers can assign user licenses
- Billing is per active user per owner account

**Professional Consortium Services (Future):**
- **Platform Transaction Fees**: Commission on telemedicine consultations and services (e.g., 15-20% of consultation fee)
- **Professional Subscriptions**: Veterinarians and nutritionists pay monthly fee to be listed in the consortium
- **Premium Consultations**: Higher-tier professionals can charge premium rates
- **Custom Programs**: Nutritionists can sell custom feeding/growth programs through the platform
- **Payment Processing Fees**: Standard transaction fees (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)

**Value Proposition:**
- Farmers: Affordable farm management + access to professional network
- Professionals: New client acquisition channel + telemedicine revenue stream
- Platform: Scalable marketplace model with recurring revenue

## 2. Membership & Organizational Structure

The application supports a multi-tenant organizational hierarchy where an Owner can manage multiple farms, each with its own staff, animals, and resources.

### Organizational Hierarchy

- **Owner**: Top-level account holder who can create and manage multiple farms
  - Can own multiple farms
  - Has full administrative access across all owned farms
  - Can assign users to specific farms with designated roles

- **Farm**: Individual farm entity with its own profile and resources
  - Each farm has its own assigned users
  - Each farm has its own animals
  - Each farm can have assigned veterinarians
  - Farm-specific settings and configurations

### User Roles

- **Owner**: Full access across all owned farms
  - Create and manage farms
  - Manage animals
  - Manage providers (veterinarians, blacksmiths, feed suppliers, breeding stock)
  - Manage users and role assignments
  - Can move animals between farms owned by the same Owner
  
- **Manager**: Farm-level administrator with full access to assigned farm(s)
  - Manage animals
  - Manage providers
  - Can move animals between farms owned by the same Owner
  
- **Lead**: Supervisory role with elevated permissions on assigned farm(s)
  - Manage animals (CRUD operations, health records, breeding, services)
  - Cannot manage providers
  
- **Farm Hand**: Basic access for day-to-day operations on assigned farm(s)
  - Read-only access to view animal information and records
  - Cannot create, edit, or delete records

### Key Relationships

- One Owner → Many Farms
- One Farm → Many Users (with assigned roles)
- One Farm → Many Animals
- **One Animal → One Farm** (an animal can only be assigned to one farm at a time)
- One Farm → Many Veterinarians (assigned)
- One User → Many Farms (with different roles per farm)
- **Licensing**: Each owner who assigns a user must license that user separately ($5/month per user per owner)

## 3. Animal Categories & Classifications

The application tracks five species with standardized age categories and gender-specific types.

### Species
- Horses
- Cattle
- Goats
- Sheep
- Donkeys

### Age Categories (Universal across all species)
- **Baby**: Foal (horse), Calf (cattle/donkey), Kid (goat), Lamb (sheep)
- **Weanling**: Recently weaned from mother
- **Yearling**: Between 1-2 years old
- **Adult**: Mature animal (2+ years)

### Gender/Type Classifications by Species

**Horses:**
- Colt (intact male)
- Gelding (castrated male)
- Filly (young female)
- Mare (adult female)
- Stallion (intact adult male)

**Cattle:**
- Bull (intact male)
- Steer (castrated male)
- Heifer (young female, not yet calved)
- Cow (adult female, has calved)

**Goats:**
- Buckling (young intact male)
- Buck (adult intact male)
- Wether (castrated male)
- Doeling (young female)
- Doe/Nanny (adult female)

**Sheep:**
- Ram (intact male)
- Wether (castrated male)
- Ewe (female)

**Donkeys:**
- Jack (intact male)
- Gelding (castrated male)
- Jenny (female)

## 3A. Animal Services & Health Management

### Medical Administration Permissions
- **Owner, Manager, Lead**: Can administer basic over-the-counter medication
- **Owner, Manager**: Can record advanced medication/services and reference the veterinarian who performed the service
- **Veterinarian Required**: Advanced medication and prescriptions (recorded by Owner/Manager)

### Services Tracked
- Routine shots/vaccinations
- Castration
- Dehorning
- Blacksmith/Farrier services
- Pregnancy checks
- Hormone treatments
- Veterinary services (general)
- **Lactation tracking** (for dairy animals: cattle, goats, sheep):
  - Lactation round/year (manually initiated when milking begins)
  - A lactation year only counts if the animal is actively milked
  - If baby is left to nurse, that year does not count as a lactation round
  - Frequency of milking per day (typically twice daily)
  - **Amount collected per milking session** (critical metric)
  - **Milk production tracking**: High producers have greater value and produce more valuable offspring
  - Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly production totals
  - **Important for show animals**: Milking protects the udder from deformation caused by rough nursing
  - Track whether animal is being milked vs. nursing baby

### Breeding & Reproduction Tracking
- **Breeding Events**: Natural or AI (Artificial Insemination)
- **Breeding Status**: Bred or Open
- **Heat Status**: 
  - Manual entry of heat cycles
  - Automatic calculation/prediction of next heat cycle based on historical data
  - Reminders when heat is expected
- **Birthing Schedule**: Expected due dates
- **Weaning Schedule**: Weaning dates and methods

### Health Records
- Medication administration (OTC and prescription)
- Treatment records
- General health events and observations

### Document Management
Each animal profile supports file uploads for:
- **Registration Papers**: Official breed registration documents
- **Health Records**: Test results, medical reports, treatment history
- **Images**: Photos of ailments/injuries, progress photos
- **Supporting Documentation**: Other relevant files
- **Animal Avatar**: Primary photo for visual identification

**File Management**:
- Documents categorized by type
- Multiple files allowed per category
- File size limits enforced per upload

## 3B. Providers & External Resources

The application tracks various service providers and external resources used across farms.

### Provider Types

**Blacksmiths/Farriers**
- Contact information
- Service areas
- Service history with farm animals

**Veterinarians**
- Contact information

- Credentials and certifications
- Available for consultation requests
- Can create custom feeding programs

**Feed Suppliers**
